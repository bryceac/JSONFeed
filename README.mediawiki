=JSONFeed=

'''Author:''' Bryce Campbell

'''Description:''' A Swift library to help parse and create JSON feeds, based upon the spec, as specified the [https://jsonfeed.org/version/1 | JSONFeed website].

'''Version:''' 0.1

==Notes==

This library utilizes Codable to encode and decode feeds, so it >strong>should</strong> work with Swift version 4, but it is not guaranteed, as this code has only been tested with Swift version 5.

Right now, the models are basic enough that there should not be any troubles compiling in version of Swift earlier than 5.

==Support==

As this library is newly created, and not yet tested, I cannot provide any help, though I have tried to make sure to comment things well enough to make things easy to figure out.
